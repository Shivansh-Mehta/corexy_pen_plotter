[Project for a compulsory credit course in my graduate program.]
Name: Workshop Mechatronics
Details: We have to fabricate a pen-plotter device with a given set of components: 
1x ESP32-NodeMCU, 
2x Geared DC Motor, 
1x DRV8833 Motor Driver, 
4x XSS-5GL13 End-Stop Switch, 
1x 9G Micro Servo Motor,
1x MB102 Power Supply Module,
2x IR Slotted Disc Sensor
Target: To sketch a Nikolas Haus diagram with decent repeatability and accuracy.
Design: We are using 3D printed components along with standard linear bearings and stainless steel shafts for the assembly. We are aiming to use a CoreXY configuration for the kinematics.
